## üö¢ How To Play

### Placing ships:
- Drag ships to move.
- Click ships to rotate.
- Ships must have one cell of orthogonal space betweeen them (Diagonal okay.)
- Press `Ready` to lock in your placements.

### Playing:
- The UI is controlled by the current attacker, shown in the bottom left.
- Click on a board to begin attacking it.
- Hit back to go back to the grid layout.
- Click on a cell to fire.
- If you hit a ship, it stays your turn. If you missed, the turn transfers to the attacked player.
- When there are just two players remaining, the game transitions to 1v1 mode, where you only view the other opponent's board.
